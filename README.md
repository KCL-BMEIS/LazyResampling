# LazyResampling
A reference implementation of lazy resampling for pytorch, meant to accompany "Lazy Resampling: fast and information preserving preprocessing for deep learning".

This repository is a placeholder for a standalone reference implementation. The current reference implementation used in the paper is available at [https://github.com/atbenmurray/MONAI/tree/lr_development](https://github.com/atbenmurray/MONAI/tree/lr_development).

This repository additionally contains the python notebooks and instructions for replicating the results of the experiments described in the paper.
